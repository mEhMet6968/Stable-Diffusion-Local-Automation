# Stable-Diffusion-Local-Automation
A lightweight and efficient setup for running Stable Diffusion locally on a mid‑range laptop. This project demonstrates how an Intel i5‑12th Gen CPU, NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU, and 16 GB RAM can reliably generate high‑quality images using optimized pipelines, half‑precision weights, and memory‑efficient runtimes.
